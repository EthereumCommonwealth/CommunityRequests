# Community Requests

This repo is created to track the feature requests, feedbacks and issue reports discovered by the Callisto Community. Since there is no clear way of communicating between the development team and the users it was decided to create this public github repo and handle discussions in a transparent way.

## Submitting a Request

Follow these steps to submit a proposal / feature request / bug report or any other issue report:

- Register a Github account.

- Go to [EthereumCommonwealth/CommunityRequests/issues](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/CommunityRequests/issues).

- Click a [New Issue button](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/CommunityRequests/issues/new).

- Describe your proposal or request.

- Submit New issue.

The request will be reviewed by the development team and discussed on the next team call. After that, it will be accepted, declined or placed on hold which will be reflected in the request issue.
